    <p>Our family loves restaurants very much, we like to visit new places, notice details, try new dishes. In general, I have always dreamed of cooking delicious food and opening a cafe.</p>
    <p>I'll probably start from the beginning. When we were looking for a place for a restaurant, we counted on 100 square meters, but it turned out that with such an area, the kitchen would be able to give only freezing and preparations. It was important for us to cook our own food in order to be completely sure of its quality and taste. So our area has increased to 200 square meters.</p>
    <p>It is very important to create a team that you can trust. I remember that even at the construction stage we went to rest, entrusting the work to foremen, itâ€™s good when there is an opportunity to just take it and relax for a while, if you constantly keep everything under your control, you can quickly burn out.</p>
